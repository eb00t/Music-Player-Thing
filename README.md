## What does our project do?
Our project is a music player. It contains many visualisers (such as a rotating cube and a dance floor), an audio scrubber and the ability to pause and unpause the music track at any time.

## What are the controls?
The player can be paused and unpaused at any time by pressing space. It also contains a scrubber, which allows for the movement of the audio track to specific points in the song.

## How does the project run?
The project immediately plays the music whenever the Processing sketch is run.

## What are we most proud of?

| Erik W | I'm most proud of the kind of framework that I set up for the project (i.e. variable to sync stuff to music, queueing classes, getting minim to work in classes). Given this is more boring than a fancy effect it was the most challenging at the time I made it and was a good bit of fun to figure out using classes in procesing. |

| Eoghan | I was most proud of the rotating CDs as getting them to work properly was a lot harder than I thought it would be. It was satisfying seeing them finally work. | 

## What each team member did?

| Erik W | Set up a variable (musicAvg) for calculations that want to sync to the music. For this, I had to clone the array of audioBuffer.size() to abClone() and sending them into classes. A simple system for queueing classes (each class holds a separate visual effect) that runs at specific set times. Progress bar/ scrubber that allows you to change the position of the audio. Also pressing space to pause and unpause. There is also a timer that required calculating seconds/minutes from milliseconds and adding a 0 if the second was a single digit to prevent '4:9' instead of '4:09' being displayed. Simple bar visualiser, can be set to have smallest -> biggest music value graphs. Cube visualiser that rotates, changes size and colour based on the musicAvg variable. Some work with Eoghan on the dance floor class, making it work with the music. |

| Eoghan | I helped with the dance floor and disco ball. I also made the rotating CDs. |

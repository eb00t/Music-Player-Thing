# Music Player Thing
 
## What does our project do?
Our project is a music player. It contains many visualisers (such as a rotating cube and a dance floor), an audio scrubber and the ability to pause and unpause the music track at any time.

## What are the controls?
The player can be paused and unpaused at any time by pressing space. It also contains a scrubber, which allows for the movement of the audio track to specific points in the song.

## How does the project run?
The project immediately plays the music whenever the Processing sketch is run.

## What are we most proud of?

| Erik W | I'm most proud of the kind of framework that I set up for the project (i.e. variable to sync stuff to music, queueing classes, getting minim to work in classes). Given this is more boring than a fancy effect it was the most challenging at the time I made it and was a good bit of fun to figure out using classes in procesing. |

| Eoghan | I was most proud of the rotating CDs as getting them to work properly was a lot harder than I thought it would be. It was satisfying seeing them finally work. |

# Music Player Thing
 
## What does our project do?
Our project is a music player. It contains many visualisers (such as a rotating cube and a dance floor), an audio scrubber and the ability to pause and unpause the music track at any time.

## What are the controls?
The player can be paused and unpaused at any time by pressing space. It also contains a scrubber, which allows for the movement of the audio track to specific points in the song.

## How does the project run?
The project immediately plays the music whenever the Processing sketch is run.
